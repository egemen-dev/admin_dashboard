# admin_dashboard

This project assignment is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) curriculum.

Desktop size admin dashboard page. This assignment's target was practicing "grid" and flexbox together. It has some flaws but it's meeting requirements.
